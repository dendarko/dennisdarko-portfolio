## Why this topic matters

Most RAG demos succeed on a small set of happy-path prompts. Production systems fail because data freshness, retrieval quality, and evaluation discipline are treated as afterthoughts.

## What I teach in this session

- How to scope a RAG use case around a measurable workflow
- Chunking and metadata strategies that support traceable answers
- Golden-set creation for retrieval and answer-quality regression testing
- Observability basics: traces, latency, token cost, and failure taxonomy

## Workshop format (starter outline)

1. Define one business question and an answer format.
2. Build ingestion + retrieval.
3. Add evaluation checks.
4. Add guardrails and monitoring.
5. Review failure cases and next iteration.

## Suggested exercises

- Create a citation-required prompt template.
- Compare vector-only vs hybrid retrieval on a small dataset.
- Design a release gate using evaluation thresholds.
