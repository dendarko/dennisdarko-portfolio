## Roadmap lens

I teach this transition as a progression in reliability responsibility:

- Python scripting (solve the task)
- Data/ML workflows (measure the task)
- ML engineering (package the task)
- MLOps/LLMOps (operate the task safely at scale)

## Skills progression

1. Python fundamentals, testing, packaging
2. SQL + data modeling + basic statistics
3. Model training and experiment tracking
4. APIs, Docker, CI/CD
5. Monitoring, evaluation, and production operations

## Practical projects

- Script automation tool
- Small prediction API
- Model retraining pipeline
- LLM evaluation harness
- RAG app with tracing and guardrails

## Teaching note

The goal is not to learn every tool. The goal is to learn how to make systems observable, testable, and maintainable.
