## Core idea

If a team cannot describe how a prompt or model change is evaluated, it is not ready to treat the feature as production software.

## Topics I cover

- Test set design for business tasks
- Deterministic checks vs rubric scoring
- Regression thresholds and release gates
- Cost/latency metrics as part of quality
- Failure triage loops and dataset maintenance

## Hands-on activities

- Write a rubric for a summarization task
- Build a JSONL test set with edge cases
- Create a CI summary report from evaluation outputs

## Outcome

Participants leave with a reusable evaluation template they can adapt to their LLM projects.
