## Checklist

- Define target tasks and answer formats.
- Build a representative golden dataset.
- Score retrieval relevance separately from answer quality.
- Require citation presence and citation correctness checks.
- Track unsupported questions and fallback behavior.
- Measure latency and cost per query type.
- Test prompt injection and adversarial inputs.
- Compare retrieval configurations (chunking, top-k, hybrid).
- Run regression tests on prompt/model changes.
- Review failure clusters and update datasets regularly.
