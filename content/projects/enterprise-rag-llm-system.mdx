problem: Teams needed fast answers across internal documentation, but existing search and chat tools were inconsistent, hard to trust, and impossible to monitor.
built: A production RAG service with ingestion pipelines, retrieval quality evaluation, prompt safety checks, and request-level tracing.

## System design

- Built an ingestion pipeline that normalizes docs, chunks content by semantic boundaries, and stores embeddings with metadata for source-aware citations.
- Added hybrid retrieval (keyword + vector) with re-ranking to improve answer grounding on long operational runbooks.
- Implemented a service boundary between retrieval, generation, and evaluation so each component could be independently tested and upgraded.
- Exposed a typed API contract for chat requests, session state, and citation payloads to simplify frontend integration.

## Evaluation / Quality

- Created a golden dataset of representative enterprise questions across onboarding, IT support, policy, and sales operations.
- Added retrieval relevance checks, citation completeness checks, and response faithfulness review criteria for release candidates.
- Ran regression evaluation in CI for prompt/template changes and blocked merges when critical scenarios dropped below threshold.
- Logged failed prompts and unsupported queries into a triage queue to expand coverage each sprint.

## Reliability / Security

- Applied request rate limiting and API key auth for internal consumers.
- Added prompt injection defense layers: instruction stripping, tool allowlists, source domain restrictions, and citation-required output format checks.
- Implemented timeout budgets, fallback responses, and circuit-breaker behavior when model or vector services degraded.
- Centralized tracing and structured logs for incident diagnosis (latency spikes, retrieval misses, malformed citations).

## Results

- Reduced average time-to-answer for internal knowledge tasks from ~15 minutes to under 90 seconds in pilot workflows.
- Increased answer trust by requiring source citations and exposing retrieval snippets for human verification.
- Cut support escalations for repeated policy questions by routing users to grounded responses first.

## Next improvements

- Add tenant-specific evaluation slices for different departments.
- Introduce model routing for cost/latency optimization by query complexity.
- Expand document freshness signals and stale-content alerts.
