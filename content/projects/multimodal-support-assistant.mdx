problem: Support teams needed faster triage for tickets containing screenshots, logs, and product documentation references.
built: A multimodal assistant that combines text/image triage, knowledge retrieval, and escalation routing with guardrail checks.

## System design

- Built a pipeline that extracts ticket text, parses attachments, and creates multimodal context objects for downstream processing.
- Routed requests through retrieval, classification, and response generation steps depending on confidence and policy constraints.
- Added escalation hooks when confidence was low, policy risk was high, or a human approval step was required.
- Standardized response objects to include recommended actions, evidence, and escalation rationale.

## Evaluation / Quality

- Benchmarked ticket routing accuracy, retrieval relevance, and response usefulness on a curated support dataset.
- Added regression tests for attachment edge cases (blurry screenshots, partial logs, missing metadata).
- Measured escalation precision to reduce false automation on complex tickets.
- Tracked latency by stage to identify bottlenecks in attachment processing.

## Reliability / Security

- Isolated attachment processing and applied file validation before ingestion.
- Added redaction checks for secrets and PII in logs/screenshots before persistence.
- Applied prompt injection defenses to retrieved content and user-submitted text.
- Defined timeouts and fallbacks for partial analysis when image processing failed.

## Results

- Improved first-pass ticket triage consistency and reduced manual classification effort in pilot usage.
- Increased transparency through evidence-backed recommendations and explicit confidence signals.
- Created a clear roadmap for production hardening with scoped guardrails and escalation policies.

## Next improvements

- Add domain adapters for multiple product lines.
- Introduce fine-grained policy actions for regulated support scenarios.
- Expand human feedback loops to improve routing confidence calibration.
