problem: Teams had working models but no consistent approval workflow for promotions, rollback decisions, or audit evidence.
built: A model governance pipeline that formalizes validation checks, registry approvals, deployment gates, and drift monitoring.

## System design

- Centralized model artifacts in a registry with environment-specific promotion states.
- Added validation jobs for data checks, performance thresholds, and packaging requirements before deployment approval.
- Triggered deployment pipelines only after policy checks passed and approvers signed off.
- Emitted deployment metadata for traceability across staging and production clusters.

## Evaluation / Quality

- Encoded acceptance criteria per model family (classification, ranking, forecasting).
- Stored benchmark results with versioned datasets for comparison across releases.
- Automated post-deploy smoke tests and alerting for metric regressions.
- Included rollback playbooks when drift or error rates crossed thresholds.

## Reliability / Security

- Enforced least-privilege service accounts for registry and deployment operations.
- Signed artifacts and tracked checksums for promoted model packages.
- Added monitoring for serving latency, prediction volume, and drift indicators.
- Maintained audit logs linking code SHA, dataset version, model version, and deploy approver.

## Results

- Reduced manual handoffs during model release while improving compliance readiness.
- Improved incident response through clear rollback triggers and deployment lineage.
- Standardized release quality criteria across multiple teams.

## Next improvements

- Add approval policy-as-code for domain-specific requirements.
- Expand drift diagnostics with feature-level explanations.
- Integrate canary rollout scoring before full promotion.
