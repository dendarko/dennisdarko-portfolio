problem: Finance and operations teams spent significant time manually reviewing earnings-call transcripts and performance notes for recurring trends.
built: An LLM-backed analysis service that extracts themes, generates grounded summaries, and maps findings to evidence snippets with citations.

## System design

- Ingested transcript and report files, extracted metadata, and generated embeddings for section-level retrieval.
- Built a workflow that combines structured metric parsing with qualitative theme extraction for a balanced output.
- Added a response schema so generated summaries include confidence notes, cited excerpts, and follow-up questions.
- Designed API endpoints for batch analysis jobs and interactive deep dives.

## Evaluation / Quality

- Created sample analyst tasks (trend detection, risk extraction, management commentary comparison) and benchmark prompts against them.
- Added citation checks to ensure every key claim links back to transcript evidence.
- Tracked latency and token cost per analysis mode (quick scan vs deep review).
- Collected analyst feedback on usefulness and missing context to improve prompts and retrieval settings.

## Reliability / Security

- Implemented job queue retries and idempotent processing for large transcript batches.
- Scoped access to uploaded files and output summaries by user/team role.
- Applied prompt hardening to separate user instructions from retrieved evidence and system policy.
- Logged provider errors and degraded gracefully to partial outputs when a sub-step failed.

## Results

- Turned recurring transcript review workflows into reusable analysis runs with consistent outputs.
- Improved collaboration by giving teams shared summaries plus direct evidence references.
- Created a path to integrate qualitative analysis with existing finance dashboards.

## Next improvements

- Add company/sector benchmark comparisons across multiple quarters.
- Introduce human feedback capture to refine themes and tone per team.
- Export structured findings directly into BI tools.
